## Introduction to DynamoDB:

1. **Fully Managed Service**: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service, which means AWS takes care of administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, setup, configuration, replication, backups, and scaling, allowing developers to focus on application development.

2. **NoSQL Database**: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use the traditional relational database model. Instead, it offers a flexible schema that allows for the storage and retrieval of data in key-value and document formats.

3. **Highly Scalable**: DynamoDB scales seamlessly to handle any amount of traffic, from a few requests per second to millions of requests per second, without requiring any manual intervention. It automatically partitions data across servers to maintain consistent performance as the workload grows.

4. **Low Latency**: DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency for read and write operations, making it suitable for latency-sensitive applications such as gaming, ad tech, real-time analytics, and more.

5. **Flexible Data Model**: DynamoDB supports both key-value and document data models. It allows developers to store and retrieve structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

6. **Consistent Performance**: DynamoDB offers predictable and consistent performance regardless of the scale of the workload. It uses SSD storage to ensure low-latency access to data and provides consistent read and write performance across all partitions.

### Important Features of DynamoDB:

1. **Primary Key and Secondary Indexes**: DynamoDB allows you to define primary keys for data retrieval and supports secondary indexes for querying data using alternate attributes. This enables flexible querying and efficient data access patterns.

2. **Auto Scaling**: DynamoDB provides auto-scaling capabilities that automatically adjust read and write capacity to accommodate changes in traffic patterns. This helps optimize costs and ensures consistent performance.

3. **Global Tables**: DynamoDB Global Tables allow you to replicate data across multiple AWS regions for high availability and disaster recovery. It ensures low-latency access to data for users located in different geographic regions.

4. **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)**: DynamoDB Accelerator is an in-memory caching service that provides high-performance read access to DynamoDB tables. It helps reduce read latency and improve the scalability of read-heavy workloads.

5. **Streams**: DynamoDB Streams capture changes to data in real-time and enable event-driven architectures. Applications can process these streams to react to changes, trigger workflows, and maintain secondary indexes.

6. **Security and Encryption**: DynamoDB supports encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data. It integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control and supports VPC endpoints for secure network communication.

Overall, DynamoDB offers a highly scalable, high-performance, and fully managed NoSQL database solution that can handle a wide range of use cases, from low-latency applications to globally distributed systems.

## Partition and Sort key:
**Partition Key:**

* It's the primary key attribute that determines how DynamoDB distributes data across partitions (physical storage units).
* It's required for every table.
* DynamoDB uses the partition key's value to calculate a hash, which maps the item to a specific partition.
* Items with the same partition key value are stored together on the same partition.

**Best Practices for Choosing a Partition Key:**

* **Select an attribute that has a wide range of values.** This helps with even data distribution across partitions.
* **Choose an attribute that is frequently used in access patterns.** This enables efficient retrieval of items.
* **Consider using a composite partition key (partition key and sort key) if you need to query multiple items with the same partition key value in a specific order.**

**Sort Key:**

* It's an optional attribute that, when combined with the partition key, forms a composite primary key.
* It's used to sort items within a partition in ascending order.
* It allows for efficient range queries on items that have the same partition key value.

**Best Practices for Choosing a Sort Key:**

* **Select an attribute that naturally orders items within a partition.** For example, timestamps for events or usernames for user data.
* **Choose an attribute that is frequently used in range queries.** For instance, retrieving items within a specific date range or alphabetically by username.
* **Avoid using attributes with high cardinality or frequently updated values as sort keys.** This can lead to performance issues and increased costs.

**Remember:**
* The partition key and sort key (if used) are immutable once a table is created.
* Choose them carefully based on your application's access patterns to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

## Understanding DynamoDB Capacity

**Capacity in DynamoDB refers to the amount of read and write operations that a table can handle per second.** It's a crucial concept to grasp when designing and managing your DynamoDB tables to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Read Capacity Units (RCUs):** Measure the number of read operations (like `GetItem`, `Query`, `Scan`) a table can handle per second.
- **Write Capacity Units (WCUs):** Measure the number of write operations (like `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`) a table can handle per second.
- **Provisioned Throughput:** You specify the desired RCUs and WCUs for a table when creating it. This allocates resources and ensures predictable performance.
- **On-Demand Capacity Mode:** DynamoDB automatically scales capacity based on your application's needs, eliminating the need for manual provisioning.

**How It Works (with Example):**

1. **Provisioning Capacity:**
   - With provisioned capacity mode, you specify the amount of read and write capacity units your table requires. Read capacity units (RCUs) represent the number of strongly consistent reads per second (or double that for eventually consistent reads), while write capacity units (WCUs) represent the number of writes per second.
   - Suppose you anticipate that your application will need to perform 100 reads and 50 writes per second on average. You provision 100 RCUs and 50 WCUs for your DynamoDB table. Even if your actual workload fluctuates, DynamoDB ensures that you can perform up to 100 reads and 50 writes per second without being throttled.
   
2. **On-Demand (Consuming) Capacity:**
   -  In on-demand capacity mode, DynamoDB automatically scales your table's capacity up or down based on the actual workload. You pay for the capacity you use on a per-request basis.
   - With on-demand capacity mode, you don't need to specify provisioned capacities. DynamoDB automatically adjusts the throughput capacity in response to traffic spikes or drops, ensuring that your application can handle any workload without being throttled.
   - Each read or write operation consumes a certain amount of capacity units.
   - The amount consumed depends on:
     - Item size
     - Operation type (e.g., strongly consistent reads consume more RCUs than eventually consistent reads)

**Example:**
Consider an e-commerce application that uses DynamoDB to store product catalog information. During normal hours, the application serves a moderate number of user requests for browsing products, viewing details, and updating inventory. However, during promotional events or holiday seasons, the traffic to the application significantly increases.

- **Provisioned Capacity**: If the application uses provisioned capacity mode, the developer provisions sufficient RCUs and WCUs to handle the anticipated peak traffic during promotional events. DynamoDB ensures that the table can handle the specified number of reads and writes per second without throttling.
  
- **On-Demand Capacity**: If the application uses on-demand capacity mode, DynamoDB automatically scales the table's capacity up or down based on the incoming requests. During promotional events, DynamoDB increases the provisioned throughput to accommodate the surge in traffic, and it scales down the capacity during normal hours to optimize costs.

In both cases, DynamoDB ensures that the application can handle varying workloads while providing consistent performance and avoiding throttling of requests. The choice between provisioned and on-demand capacity depends on the application's traffic patterns, cost considerations, and the need for predictable throughput provisioning.

## Partition Key vs Local Secondary Index vs Global Secondary Index

| Feature | Partition Key | Local Secondary Index (LSI) | Global Secondary Index (GSI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Definition** |  Identifies the partition in which an item is stored, and queries are scoped to a single partition. | Index for efficient queries within a partition | Index for efficient queries across all partitions |
| **Queries** | Determines where data is stored and quickly retrieved | Enables fast range queries and filtering within a partition | Enables queries on non-partition key attributes across all partitions |
| **Scope** | Single partition | Single partition | Entire table |
| **Cost** | No additional cost | No additional cost | Additional cost, charged per read and write capacity unit |
| **Consistency** | Strongly consistent with table | Strongly consistent with table | Eventually consistent with table |
| **How Many**| Every table must have a primary key, which can be either: Simple primary key: A single attribute (partition key). Composite primary key: Two attributes (partition key and sort key). |You can create up to 5 LSIs per table. However, each LSI must share the same partition key as the table's primary key. They can only have a different sort key. | We can create up to 20 GSIs per table.GSIs can have a different partition key and sort key than the table's primary key. However, keep in mind that GSIs incur additional costs for read and write capacity units. |
| **Best Practices** | Wide range of values, frequent access | Frequently queried attributes within partition | Frequently queried non-partition key attributes across table |
